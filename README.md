Developed a comprehensive GIS-based application to map and track medical imaging facilities across Nigeria. The platform features a custom survey tool for field data collection, which feeds into a real-time analytics dashboard. I implemented a live interactive map to visualize equipment distribution and density. This tool enables stakeholders to identify healthcare gaps through data-driven insights. I handled the end-to-end process: from building the survey engine and database architecture to creating the GIS mapping interface and analytical charts.
